# Data-Glacier

An internship involving 3 projects and 2 other components split over 13 weeks.
Week 1: Learning Git, Bitbucket and then Project Management frameworks Kanban, Scrum and the Agile methodology.
Week 2: In-depth analysis of two cab companies, Pink Cab and Yellow Cab, including customer retention, forecasting, percentage changes and Geospatial Analysis.
Week 3: Prepared a EDA presentation on powerpoint with visualisations, findings and recommendations presented to stakeholders about which company to invest in.
Week 4: Took a simple dataset, cleaned, pre-processed and wrangled the data, built a Support Vector Machine to predict final grades and deployed this in a Flask Application.
Week 5: Deployed this specific Flask application in Heroku.
Week 6: File Ingestion and Schema Validation exercise, comparing dask, ray and modin and pandas loading time, before creating a yaml file to store database information.
Project Weeks (Week 7-12): On a Bank Marketing dataset, we are trying to predict the Binary Classification problem of whether a customer will purchase a Term Deposit. We compare a linear model, an ensemble model, then boosting, bagging and stacking models on performance metrics, Lift or Gain, KS-Statistics, Precision-Recall Curves and ROC curves before deciding on our final model. We then create a Flask application, and deploy this model using Heroku.
